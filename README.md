# challenge-1
I was tasked with making sure the website met accessibility standards, had semantic HTML elements, had alt attributes, and a descriptive title. I have made changes to the HTML and CSS code base for better scaleability as well as to meet the tasks needed. The changes have changed all of the div tags to appropriate tags for the sections. CSS was updated to no longer have repetitive code.
